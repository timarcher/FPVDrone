ARMING_RUDDER,2  # Allow arm or disarm by rudder input.
FLTMODE_CH,6  # RC channel to use for flight mode control. We need to use 6 since ELRS hard codes ch 5 to throttle cut.
FS_THR_ENABLE,1  # The throttle failsafe allows you to configure a software failsafe activated by a setting on the throttle input channel. Set to Enabled, always RTL. If the GPS position is not usable, the copter will change to Land Mode instead.
FS_THR_VALUE,975  # The PWM level in microseconds on channel 3 below which throttle failsafe triggers. FS_THR_VALUE must be at least 10 steps lower than RC3_MIN, which is 982.
RC_FS_TIMEOUT,1  # RC failsafe will trigger this many seconds after loss of RC.
RC_OPTIONS,288  # The default is 32. Change to 288 to enable pass-through for CRSF telemetry.
RC_PROTOCOLS,1  # Selected in the component editor
RC5_OPTION,0  # Do nothing. Leave unassigned as flight mode is setup on channel 5 by default.
RC6_OPTION,0  # Do nothing. Function assigned to rc channel 6. For example, we could pick things like "Motor Emergency Stop", "Lost rover Sound", etc
RC7_OPTION,11  # Enable/Disable fence
RC8_OPTION,0  # Do nothing. Function assigned to rc channel 8. For example, we could pick things like "Motor Emergency Stop", "Lost rover Sound", etc
RC9_OPTION,0  # Do nothing. Function assigned to rc channel 9. For example, we could pick things like "Motor Emergency Stop", "Lost rover Sound", etc
RSSI_TYPE,3  # Indicate RSSI is provided by the receiver protocol.
SERIAL6_BAUD,57  # 57 (57600) is fine. ArduPilot switches it internally to the correct CRSF baud of 400000.
SERIAL6_PROTOCOL,23  # CRSF RCIN, which should be the default.
