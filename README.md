# FPV Drone Build Project
Welcome to the 3.5" FPV Drone Build Project! This time, I’ll be putting together a compact cinewhoop designed for speed, agility, and high-quality video capture. Built around the iFlight Protek35 V1.4 frame, this drone will feature a powerful MicroAir743 V2 AM32 flight controller and ESC stack running ArduPilot firmware, paired with a MicroAir M9/M10 GPS for precise navigation. For control and reliability, I’ll be using a RadioMaster ELRS transmitter/receiver, while HDZero Goggle 2s and a RunCam Phoenix 2 Nano camera will provide crystal-clear FPV footage.

The build will also include TBS’s Unify Pro VTX for rock-solid video transmission, Emax ECO II 2207 brushless motors driving GemFan 3.5” ducted props, and a Tattu 3S LiPo battery pack for efficient flight time. From frame assembly to tuning and real-world testing, I’ll be documenting every step of the process—covering setup, insights, and lessons learned along the way.

Let’s dive into this small but mighty build and see what a 3.5” FPV drone can really do!
